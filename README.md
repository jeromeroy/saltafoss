# saltafoss
Code to help realise an artistic project by Davide Barberi.

This repo supports the creation of the project "saltafoss" (temporary name). The code helps visualizing audio files in a 3D graph.
When running the code a popup windows asks to select an audio file (change file extension on read function to switch between audio formats). The programm plots 6 different angles of the spectral plot. A .tiff file is saved for every audio file at a resolution of 600dpi.
